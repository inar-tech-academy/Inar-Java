 *One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character,
 *remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are
 *one edit (or zero edits) away.
 *EXAMPLE
 *p a l e , pie -> true
 *p a l e s , pale -> true
 *p a l e , bale -> true
 *p a l e , bake -> false
